## ${\color{lightgreen}Project \space Brief}$

Our project aims to replicate the functionality and features of the popular 
e-commerce platform, RedBubble. RedBubble is known for its marketplace where 
independent artists can show and sell their artworks on a wide range of 
products, including clothes, home decor and accessories.

The project will provide a web-based application that allows artists to create
and manage profiles and show their portfolio and information. Also, it allows 
customers to create accounts and browse artistic products upload private artworks 
and order it as custom products.

## ${\color{lightgreen}Scope \space of \space Work}$
  **For this project, we will focus on the following features:**
  - Secure registration and login functionality for artists and customers.
  - Efficient search and filtering options to enhance the user's browsing experience.
  - Artists uploading their artworks and setting prices.
  - Orders status processing through an admin panel.
  - Personalizing products through a responsive UI.
  - Users can add items to their cart and proceed to checkout to confirm the order.
  - Artists can use their accounts as a portfolio or a backup to their artworks.
  - Each artwork can be applied to various templates, resulting in a range of different products.

  **while leaving out:**
  - Payment process management:
	- The detailed management of the payment process beyond integration with a third-party 
	payment gateway will be considered out of scope.
  - Legal advice and disputes:
	- The project will not provide legal advice to artists or users regarding copyright, 
	intellectual property, or any legal disputes that may arise. Users are encouraged to 
	seek legal counsel independently.
  - Complex editing tools:
	- The project will not include complex tools or features for restoring or editing uploaded artwork. 
	Artists are expected to upload finished and finalized pieces.
  - Product delivery and logistics:
	- The project will not involve the management or coordination of product delivery logistics. 

## ${\color{lightgreen}Outputs}$
**The following outputs will be produced:**

  panel to control processing orders.

- A backend API to handle user registration and authentication as well as
  database queries according to each user's session's context.
